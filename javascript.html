// DEMANDS (these get a bit annoying after a while)	

confirm ("Hello, welcome to the page, this mainly includes fucking around with variables and other fun things I never knew Java could do - like this!!")
prompt("Before we start, can you please enter your name to the site? It doesn't go anywhere yet. Just a cool arse pop up")

// VARIABLES

document.write(Number.MAX_VALUE+"<br />"); // the max amount of characters Javascript can handle (don't 100% understand this)
document.write(Number.MIN_VALUE+"<br />"); // the min amount of characters Javascript can handle (don't 100% understand this - letters are shwoing)

var a = "coldplay"; // my first variable, dedicated to Coldplay
document.write(a + "<br />"); // document.write allows you to print a variable onto a page (I think)

var e = "blur" .length; // using the length tools here, it spits our the number of letters used
document.write(e + "<br />"); 

var b = "bonjovi"; // my second variable
var c = "pixies"; // my thrid variable

var combined = b + c; // a function which combines two variables together
document.write(combined + "<br />"); // trying to add breaks which break up the page

// ADDING VARIABLES TOGETHER

var d = 5; // wrapping variables in quotes means your NAMING that variable
var e = 10; // not adding quotes means your assigning a variable a number (I think??)

var total = d + e; // I'm adding two varibales here to a new variable, no idea where this could be used in practice, but it's cool!

document.write (total + "<br />"); // This works

document.write (d + e + "<br />"); // This has the same result though. In what cases would you create other varibales or not?

// OBJECTS

var beatles = "hey I'm ringo star"

document.write (beatles.length) //length here is a property

// I saw a good analogy where objects can be compared with a person. Onject name: Ed, properties: lanky, methods: spits when talks. 

var person = {
    firstName : "Ed", // I'm presuming that 'firstname' is an ID. That's why is capthes the data when you use the command getElementById
    lastName  : "Davies",
    age       : 28,
    eyeColor  : "blue"
};

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
person.firstname + " is " + person.age + " years old";


// BOOLEANS (didn't go into that much detail with booleans - kind of get it)

"I'm trying my hardest".length > 20; // Booleans return true or false if the numbers
